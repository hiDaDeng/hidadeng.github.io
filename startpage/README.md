## URL Redirects

Searching a valid URL will redirect you to the said URL. Note that a protocol, `https://` for example, is required.

+ `https://haveibeenpwned.com/` query is valid, so you will be redirected to [https://haveibeenpwned.com/](https://haveibeenpwned.com/).
+ `google.com` is not a valid URL, so it will search it on your default search engine.
+ `www.duckduckgo.com` is also invalid because it doesn't have a protocol.

## URL Query Parameters

You can also pass a query by using the `q` parameter. The default search engine will be used.

+ `manilarome.github.io/squareup?q=how to build a nuclear reactor at home`
+ `127.0.0.1?q=how to download more RAM in google play store`
+ `file:///PATH/TO/squareup/index.html?q=how to restore system32`

## Settings and Customization

### Customizing color scheme

Change the color scheme by just clicking a button!

+ `Dark` - Dark colorscheme. Good for the night.
+ `Light` - Bright colorscheme. Good for killing the eyes.
+ `Auto` - Load a colorscheme based on time. Edit light/dark mode hours on `js/config.js` 

#### Customizing panel buttons

To add more web shortcuts/buttons on the dock, you have to edit the `panelSites` array in `js/config.js`. Make sure to put an icon with `svg` format for the shortcut in `assets/webcons/` folder.

```js
// Example
const panelSites = [
	{
		site: 'Reddit',
		icon: 'reddit',
		url: 'https://reddit.com/'
	},
	...
]
```

#### Customizing web menu

Add more items or web shortcuts in the web menu by editing the `webSites` array in `js/config.js`. Make sure to put an icon with `svg` format for the shortcut in `assets/webcons/` folder. 

```js
// Example
const webSites = [
	{
		site: 'Reddit',
		icon: 'reddit',
		url: 'https://reddit.com/',
		category: 'social'
	},
	...
]
```

#### Customizing quick search

Add more quick search shortcuts by editing the `quickSearchData` object in `js/config.js`. Make sure to follow the format below:

```js
// Example
const quickSearchData = {
	'r/': {
		urlPrefix: 'https://reddit.com/r/'
	},
	...
}
```

#### Switch default search engine

Startpage is the default search engine, if you want to change it, just click the switcher button on the panel.

Available search engines:

+ Startpage
+ Qwant
+ Ecosia
+ Duckduckgo
+ Yahoo
+ Google
+ Bing

#### Customizing available search engines

Add more search engine by editing the `searchEngines` object in `js/config.js`. Make sure to follow the format below:

```js
// Example
const searchEngines = {
	'duckduckgo': {
		name: 'Duckduckgo',
		prefix: 'https://duckduckgo.com/?q='
	},
	...
}
```

#### Changing clock mode

There are two clock modes available - `24-hour` and `12-hour`. Switch between clock modes by just clicking on the clock. Simple.

### Important Note

+ Make sure that javascript is enabled in your browser!
+ Make sure to whitelist or disable `NoScript` and `Dark Mode Reader` extensions on this homepage.
+ If you are experiencing slowdowns, you can disable the animations in `css/animated-background.css`.
+ Tested only on Firefox and Google Chrome.
