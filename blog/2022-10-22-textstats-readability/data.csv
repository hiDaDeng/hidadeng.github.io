Playing games has always been thought to be important to 
the development of well-balanced and creative children; 
"however, what part, if any, they should play in the lives "
of adults has never been researched that deeply. I believe 
that playing games is every bit as important for adults 
as for children. Not only is taking time out to play games 
with our children and other adults valuable to building 
interpersonal relationships but is also a wonderful way 
to release built up tension.
