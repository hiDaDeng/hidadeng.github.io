00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,800
This is the visual interface of WordBias

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,833
Here, each axis represents a sensitive attribute like gender, race, etc.

3
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:12,466
and each blue line represents a word.

4
00:00:12,466 --> 00:00:16,399
On hovering over a word like 'nuns', we can see how it associates with

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,366
different subgroups like 'Females', 'Christianity', 'White' (race), 'Old' and 'Poor' subgroups.

6
00:00:21,366 --> 00:00:25,866
Similarly, we can brush over multiple subgroups like 'Males' and 'Islam' 

7
00:00:25,866 --> 00:00:30,399
to obtain words which associate with the intersectional group 'Muslim Males' (as per Word Embedding).
